# restore.py

Python scripts for the automatic restoration of scans of age-deteriorated colour slides / prints.

This is an authorized GitHub mirror of [original code](http://www.lionhouse.plus.com/photosoftware/restore/) written by Geoff Daniell. The aim is make it easier for others to improve and extend this code, so pull requests are welcomed!

Note that only the [standalone Python 3](http://www.lionhouse.plus.com/photosoftware/restore/stand_alone/python3/) version can be found here. The Gimp plugins and Python 2 versions may be added at a future time.

# Getting Started

For the theory behind these algorithms, please see [here](http://www.lionhouse.plus.com/photosoftware/restore/documents/).

# To-do

1. General code cleanup
1. Replace Python algorithms with standard Python implementations (from NumPy, SciPy, etc.) for speed
1. Split into smaller modules that can be shared between different versions
